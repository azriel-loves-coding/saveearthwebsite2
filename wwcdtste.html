        <p>We all have a part in saving the earth. One thing we can do individually is integrate saving the earth into each our daily lives by cultivating habits to do so which can be implemented in our everyday activities. For example, you can filter 
            recyclable objects from normal waste. After finishing milk or fruit juice cartons, drinks in plastic bottles or cans, or after using rough paper. Instead of just disposing them into the waste bin, you can put them into a separate plastic bag 
            or small bin and throw them into a recycle bin near your house. Thus, you'll be contributing to saving the earth everyday by contributing objects to be reused and recycled rather than just wasting them by simply disposing them as normal trash. 
        Other saving the earth habits you can cultivate into your daily activities include half-flushing the toilet after use, brushing your teeth from a mug and recyle old documents as rough paper or printing paper. All in all, with small habits, we all 
    can make a big change to the earth and create a better and sustainable future for ourselves as long as we all do our part and integrate some of these activities into our everyday lives .     </p>

This can be achieved by turning off lights and electronic devices when not in use, using energy-efficient light bulbs, and using natural light instead of artificial light where possible.</div>

Individuals can set goals to reduce their waste by recycling, composting, and reducing the use of disposable products like plastic bags, straws, and water bottles. They can also opt for products that are made from sustainable materials and packaged in eco-friendly materials.</div>
