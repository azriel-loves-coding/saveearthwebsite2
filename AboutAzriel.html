            <img src="carouselpic1.jpeg" class="responsive" alt="responsive">
            <p>I'm Azriel, a Year 1 student in Singapore Polytechnic(SP) studying in Common Infocomn Technology, also known as Common ICT. I came to SP via PFP, so
                this is actually my 2nd year in SP. Well, this is some background information about me. I'll be talking about my values, interests and personality in the sections below :) </p>
              </div>
                <div class="values">
            <h1>Values</h1>
            <div class="container4">
              <div class="image4">
            <img src="loyalty.jpg" class="responsive" alt="responsive">

            <div class="text4">
            <h4>1. Loyalty</h4>
            <p>“Loyalty is a two-way street. If I'm asking for it from you, then you are getting it from me.”<br>Quoted from one of my favourite fictional characters: Harvey Specter from the TV series Suits,
            meaning that loyalty comes from both sides and is not just one-sided. In order to earn loyalty from others, you have to earn it by showing it and not just expecting and demanding it.
            I value loyalty very much as friends come and go in life, but the real ones stay, and the ones who stayed are the ones who have been there for me when I wasn't the brightest person in the world and helped me throughout 
            my darkest times to help me develop in life, whether it's in improving my character or helping me achieve my goals, and are happy to see me break the glass ceiling. In comparison to some friends I had before, they were only friends 
            with me to hang out and have fun and only call me when they need something but when I want to do something for myself, they comment that I'm a "tryhard" and don't support me in achieving my goals and leave when things get tough. This 
            was what made me realise that real and loyal friends are rare and that I should treasure them as much as possible. Therefore this is why loyalty is one of my values.</p>

              <div class="text5">
            <h4>2. Humility</h4>
            <p>"Humility to the end."<br>This is a quote I came up with on my own, with inspiration from the quote "Honor, to the end" by Optimus Prime from the 4th Transformers movie: "Transformers : Age of Extinction" which means that you should 
              do things in a honourable manner throughout your life as winning isn't everything but how you do it matters as well. But that's on honor and what Optimus Prime's quote meant, my quote on humility means that no matter how good 
            you become at something, you should always remain humble and not let your ego get to you as it's a big world out there and there's plenty to learn in life, and you can always strive for greater heights. I apply humility to my life when I'm
            working towards something, whether it's an academic goal, a goal for an exercise in the gym, a coding project I'm working on or doing a jigsaw puzzle. I do so by taking consistent steps towards achieving my goals, and avoid getting 
            cocky and start slacking off when I reach a big milestone during the journey towards my goal. Like the story "Slow and Steady wins the race" where the toitoise beat the hare in a race as the hare got too cocky and slept when he's nearing the finish line while the toitoise 
            continue moving slowly towards it, showing that I should never get too cocky and start slacking off once I've become really good at something as it'll cost me bigger achievements and affect how I'll
            treat others who aren't as good as me but are trying to achieve similar goals. Instead, I should remain humble and continue learning and move on to achieve higher goals, and never look down on others but respect them for the work they put in as I was once 
            in their position. Therefore, this is why humility is one of my values as it's crucial to have as a human being and to become successful.</p>

            <h4>3. Self-reliance</h4>
            <p>"The strongest man in the world is he who stands alone."<br>Quoted by Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian playwright and theatre director during the 18s. This quote means that a man who only relies on himself has a very strong and hard to break will. Self-reliance is one of my values 
            as in life, the only person you have is yourself. Sure, you can ask others for help and point you in the right direction. But at the end of the day, it is you who's doing the work, no one can do it for you. Therefore, I believe that it is important to be comfortable being by yourself
            as people won't be there for you all the time and there will be times when all you have is yourself and that is when you will have to be independent and self-reliant. Hence, this is why I value self-reliance.</p>

            <h4>1. Reading Batman comics</h4>
            <p>"All men have limits. They learn what they are and then learn not to exceed them. I ignore mine"<br>Quoted by the caped crusader, the dark knight and the bat of Gotham himself: The Batman. Batman is my favourite DC hero and one that I look up to as he is just a human being but is able to take
            down powerful characters, he even has a contingency plan to immobilise the entire Justice League if they ever gone rogue. This shows that Batman is a strategic thinker and a really good one as he can think of all possible outcomes and prepares for it, which is also shown in the various gadgets 
            and tech he has at his disposal. Another reason why I admire Batman is his strong will and determination to protect Gotham City. The quote above is from the Batman comic: "Batman: Knightfall" where Bane broke out all the Arkham inmates and let them terrorise Gotham to mentally and physically exhaust
            Batman so that Bane will be able to break Batman easily. In spite of the face that Batman knew that someone was behind the Arkham breakout to mentally and physically exhaust him, he still went all over Gotham to stop the Arkham villains as he cares more about protecting his city and it's people than his 
            well-being, showing how committed he is to his mission to protect Gotham City and its citizens and not letting anything or anyone stand in his way of doing so, even himself. This is also reflected on the fact that he can go for 80 hours without sleep, which he does on a regular basis to watch over his city
            at night and solve crimes. But this is just Batman's character, I can't just know about him as a character and call myself a Batman fan. No, I have to know his stories as well, which is why I read Batman comics to learn about his stories and to earn the title "A true Batman fan" in my book as I believe that in
             order to be a true fan of a character, you can't just watch the movies or TV series but read the comics as well as comics are where the origins of a character are from. Thus, I started reading Batman comics this year and I'm still reading them until now and I'm enjoying every second of it.</p>

             <h4>2. Coding</h4>
            <p>This picture is me working at my Uncle's office in 2021. During the holidays after N-levels, I worked at my Uncle's office until the end of 2022. This was when I realised I enjoyed coding very much and made me choose Common ICT Programme as my course in poly. I enjoy coding as it has a problem-solving factor similar 
            to doing math questions but is more fun and intriguing as I get to keep testing and testing every time I edit my code to see if I get my desired outcome which will feel very rewarding and satisfying after all the hardwork and effort put in into doing my code. But that isn't the only thing I enjoy when coding, I enjoy the process
             of building my code, like encountering problems in the code as I get the opportunity to solve them and learn from my mistakes so that if I were to encounter the same problems again I will know how to solve them. Besides, if it's easy to code and there isn't any problems, it'll be too boring. Hence, the challenges of coding make it 
             more fun as they help me improve as a programmer and I enjoy problem-solving very much.</p>

            <h4>3. Exercise</h4>
            <p>This picture is me doing a 80kg squat in the gym. I started working out in Secondary 4 during my N level year as I wanted to get to PFP so badly that I was willing to change my mindset to get it. So I started working out as I believe it could help me improve my mentality, but I didn't know when to start so I decided to work on my pullups 
              as I had NAPFA that year and I can only do 1 pullup so I decided to start working out by working on my pullups at 1st. I worked on it consistently and never gave up in spite of the difficulties along the way. By NAPFA, I went from 1 pullup to 12 pullups. That gave me the confidence that with discipline, consistency and resilience I can achieve 
            anything I put my mind to and I applied it to me working towards PFP and in the end I did get it. But I continued exercising regularly after that until now as I could still apply the concept of discipline, consistency and resilience to other goals I may have in the future and me exercising regularly will always remind me of that. As time goes by, I 
          added more exercises to my workout and I now go to the gym instead of a fitness corner in the past to have the necessary equipment for my various exercises. Thus, gym has now become a crucial part of my daily life and I'll always try my best to make it to the gym in spite of how busy and tired I can be.   </p>

          <h4>1. Disciplined</h4>
          <p>“We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.” This means that if you are not disciplined towards achieving your goals, you will regret it in the future. Discipline is part of my personality as I have goals in life and in order to achieve them, I need to be disciplined and 
          work consistently towards them. If I do achieve them, I celebrate. If I don't, I will have the peace of mind that I did everything I could and I will have no regrets. But if I didn't work consistently for my goals due to the lack of discipline, I will realise that I would have a good chance of achieving my goals if vice versa and I'll have to live with the regret of not having the 
          discipline to work towards my goals as there's nothing I can do about it. Therefore, discipline is crucial to have in order to work towards your goals and that is why I'm disciplined whenever I want to achieve something.</p>

            <div class="text8">
          <h4>2. Hardworking</h4>
          <p>“Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.” Quoted by Tim Notke, a high school basketball coach. This quote means that raw talent can only bring you so far. But hard work can bring you even further. I am not talented in any way, but one thing's for sure is that I'm very hardworking towards achieving my goals. Whatever I set my mind to, I put the hardwork in and accomplish it.
            I don't care if others who put in less work are better than me, all I care about is that I'm working harder than them and that I'm improving constantly. Sure, they may be better than me at the moment, but if they aren't hardworking they'll stay at the same level and not improve. Therefore, in life you must be hardworking to get better in what you do and that's why I'm a hardworking person.

            <div class="text9">
          <h4>3. Introvert</h4>
          <p>I like to be alone most of the time as it's really peaceful and I can focus and indulge in my favourite things to do without being disturbed by others and whenever I do make friends, I tend to
             rely on them more and I'd rather rely on myself more than others. Hence I'm a very introverted person and avoid interacting with people most of the time and due to the lack of it I can't naturally talk to people without feeling nervous or awkward. However, my father always told me that networking is very important in the future as an adult and as much as I hate to admit it he's right. So as of now I'm trying 
            to work on my interpersonal skills so that I will be able to communicate well and have reliable connections with others in the future.</p>
